*** Swarm Robotics Coordination in Python


Project Description
  This project simulates a swarm of robots moving in a 2D space using only the Python standard library. Each robot moves in a       straight line but changes its direction randomly to avoid collisions with other robots. The robots perform a random walk, and    their positions are updated and printed at regular intervals.

What the Project Does
The project aims to demonstrate basic swarm robotics coordination. It involves multiple robots that:
  Move randomly in a 2D space.
  Detect and avoid collisions with each other by changing direction.
  Continuously update and print their positions.
